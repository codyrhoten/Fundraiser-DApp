## About

Created an application that interacts with smart contracts which maintain house deeds tokenized as NFTs and serves as a market place to list and buy these deeds (and all the property rights that go along with that in a world where legally tokenized deeds are commonplace). It is currently available to play with on the Goerli testnet.
