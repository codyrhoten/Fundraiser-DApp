## About

Created an application that interacts with smart contracts which maintain house deeds tokenized as NFTs and serves as a market place to list and buy these deeds (and all the property rights that go along with that in a world where legally tokenized deeds are commonplace). It is currently available to play with on the Goerli testnet.

### To fire it up in development environment:

*npm run dev*

**For Goerli network:**

connect wallet on Goerli network

**For Hardhat Network running locally:**

*npx hardhat node*

*npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js*

connect wallet on localhost:8545 network
